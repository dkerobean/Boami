# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement loading animations that display when users navigate between pages in the application. The loading animations will provide visual feedback to users during page transitions, improving the perceived performance and user experience by indicating that the application is responding to their navigation requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a loading animation when navigating between pages, so that I know the application is processing my request and I'm not left wondering if my click registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation link THEN the system SHALL display a loading animation immediately
2. WHEN a page transition begins THEN the system SHALL show a visual loading indicator within 100ms
3. WHEN a page has finished loading THEN the system SHALL hide the loading animation smoothly
4. WHEN multiple navigation requests occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without flickering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the loading animation to be visually appealing and consistent with the application's design, so that it feels like a natural part of the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loading animation displays THEN it SHALL match the application's color scheme and branding
2. WHEN the loading animation appears THEN it SHALL be centered and clearly visible on the screen
3. WHEN the animation runs THEN it SHALL be smooth and not cause performance issues
4. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the loading animation SHALL be responsive and appropriately sized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the loading animation to appear for a reasonable duration, so that it doesn't flash too quickly or stay too long.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads quickly (under 200ms) THEN the system SHALL show the animation for a minimum of 200ms to avoid flashing
2. WHEN a page takes longer to load THEN the system SHALL continue showing the animation until the page is ready
3. WHEN the loading animation has been visible for more than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide additional feedback or error handling
4. WHEN the page loading is complete THEN the system SHALL fade out the animation over 150ms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the loading animation to work consistently across all page transitions, so that I have a predictable experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to any route in the application THEN the system SHALL show the loading animation
2. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL display the loading animation
3. WHEN programmatic navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL show the loading animation
4. WHEN navigation is cancelled or fails THEN the system SHALL hide the loading animation and show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the loading animation system to be configurable and maintainable, so that it can be easily customized or updated in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the loading system THEN it SHALL be built as reusable components
2. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL allow customization of animation type, duration, and appearance
3. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error handling
4. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and respect user motion preferences
